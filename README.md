# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repository

Setup here based on write up at https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/
which was discovered through a post here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797

There is a script to setup the dotfiles on a new computer. Can execute with:

    curl -Lks https://gist.githubusercontent.com/individuwill/c6b4cc9183ddfb2871c20d619e024bc7/raw/2145a81a129ed42987cda452683c6dd1572230f5/setup_dotfiles.sh | bash

or maybe a little shorter

    curl -Lks http://bit.do/individuwill-dotfiles | bash
